# Docker Base Image Debian

If you are beginning your journey with
[Senzing](https://senzing.com/),
please start with
[Senzing Quick Start guides](https://docs.senzing.com/quickstart/).

You are in the
[Senzing Garage](https://github.com/senzing-garage)
where projects are "tinkered" on.
Although this GitHub repository may help you understand an approach to using Senzing,
it's not considered to be "production ready" and is not considered to be part of the Senzing product.
Heck, it may not even be appropriate for your application of Senzing!

## Overview

This repository shows best practices for creating a Debian-based
docker image upon which to deploy Senzing.

## Expectations

### Space

This repository and demonstration require 6 GB free disk space.

### Time

Budget 40 minutes to get the demonstration up-and-running, depending on CPU and network speeds.

### Background knowledge

This repository assumes a working knowledge of:

1. [Docker](https://github.com/senzing-garage/knowledge-base/blob/main/WHATIS/docker.md)

## Develop

### Prerequisite software

The following software programs need to be installed:

1. [git](https://github.com/senzing-garage/knowledge-base/blob/main/WHATIS/git.md)
1. [make](https://github.com/senzing-garage/knowledge-base/blob/main/WHATIS/make.md)
1. [docker](https://github.com/senzing-garage/knowledge-base/blob/main/WHATIS/docker.md)

### Clone repository

For more information on environment variables,
see [Environment Variables](https://github.com/senzing-garage/knowledge-base/blob/main/lists/environment-variables.md).

1. Set these environment variable values:

    ```console
    export GIT_ACCOUNT=senzing
    export GIT_REPOSITORY=docker-base-image-debian
    export GIT_ACCOUNT_DIR=~/${GIT_ACCOUNT}.git
    export GIT_REPOSITORY_DIR="${GIT_ACCOUNT_DIR}/${GIT_REPOSITORY}"
    ```

1. Follow steps in [clone-repository](https://github.com/senzing-garage/knowledge-base/blob/main/HOWTO/clone-repository.md) to install the Git repository.

### Build docker image for development

1. **Option #1:** Using `docker` command and GitHub.

    ```console
    sudo docker build \
      --tag senzing/base-image-debian \
      https://github.com/senzing-garage/docker-base-image-debian.git#main
    ```

1. **Option #2:** Using `docker` command and local repository.

    ```console
    cd ${GIT_REPOSITORY_DIR}
    sudo docker build --tag senzing/base-image-debian .
    ```

1. **Option #3:** Using `make` command.

    ```console
    cd ${GIT_REPOSITORY_DIR}
    sudo make docker-build
    ```

    Note: `sudo make docker-build-development-cache` can be used to create cached docker layers.
